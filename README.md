## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è  

- **Fetching Data**:  
  - Uses **HTTP** requests to fetch manga data (images, titles, chapters, etc.) from the **MangaDex API**.  
  - Then data is stored and managed with **Provider**.

  - `ThemeProvider` - Manages the app's theme (light/dark).  
  - `ChapterProvider` - Handles the list of chapters on the home screen.  
  - `MangaurlProvider` - Loads manga images.  
  - `LastOpenedChapterProvider` - Saves and displays the last chapter you opened.

- **Image Optimization**:
  - **CachedNetworkImage** is used to cache and preload manga images, reducing load times and improving performance.

- **Storage**:  
  - `SharedPreferences` is used to **remember** the last opened chapter and selected theme.
